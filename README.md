# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Hello! I am a junior full stack engineer with over four years of experience in computational agronomy. I started my career as an intern and currently work as a full stack engineer at the same company. My professional journey has been driven by the desire to unleash the power of technology to simplify people's lives and solve real-world problems.

In recent years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in deep learning and computer vision, exploring convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and image processing for various projects. Iâ€™ve also delved into MLOps practices, orchestrating pipelines with Amazon SageMaker, handling data versioning, and applying experiment tracking. My focus is to blend a solid theoretical background with hands-on development to deliver impactful AI-driven solutions.

Currently, I'm studying Transformers (Transformers) and LLMs (Large Language Models) and their applications in computer vision.

## My Skills

### Languages and Technologies

- **Python**: Solid four years of experience in software development and image processing.
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices in code development, CI/CD, testing, packaging and maintenance.
- **Computer Vision / Deep Learning**: Intermediate knowledge of CNNs, data augmentation, transfer learning, and key metrics (F1, IoU, mAP, etc.).
- **Transformers**: Intermediate knowledge of Transformers, LLMs, and their applications in natural language processing. Have used the HuggingFace Transformers library to build and train models like OwnV2, SAM2, CLIP, and Visual Transformer.
- **Machine Learning**: Practical experience building and deploying ML models.
- **MLOps**: Experience using SageMaker, pipelines, and experiment tracking (TensorBoard, MLflow).
- **AWS**: Working knowledge (S3, ECR, and SageMaker); pursuing more advanced certifications.

### Python Libraries

- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Image processing, homography, segmentation, and computer vision.
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computing, data manipulation, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning tools.
- **PyTorch**: Building and training neural networks.

### Recent Projects

- **Global Platform Integration**: Implementation of services and integration of a global platform, developing skills in English communication and image processing with global stakeholders.
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Development of pipelines for classification and object detection neural networks using SageMaker, S3, and ECR.
- **Homography Project**: Utilization of image processing and homography to map corresponding points in different images to auto label images from different sources.
- **Cloud Segmentation**: Application of image processing techniques to segment clouds in satellite images.
- **Auto Label**: Application of software engineering to mine data from different sources and auto classify images to create a classification dataset. After that, used OwnV2 to auto detect objects in images and create a detection dataset with a zero-shot approach.
- **Vision Transformer**: Development of a visual transformer pipeline in Sagemaker using the HuggingFace Transformers library to classify images.
- **Bounding Box Generation**: Used OwnV2 to generate bounding boxes in datasets where I knew only the image content with 98% accuracy.

## Goals

### Professional

- **AWS Certification**: Aim to obtain Machine Learning certification.
- **International Career**: Development of an international career plan.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Interest in sharing acquired knowledge with the team.
- **Continuous Learning**: Pursue knowledge in new technologies and tools.
- **Agile Methodologies**: Interest in Agile methodologies and their application in software development.
- **Problem Solving**: Interest in problem solving and the application of software engineering to solve real-world problems.
- **Fast Learning**: Fast and self-taught learner.
- **Multidisciplinary**: Interest in interdisciplinary projects and the application of software engineering to solve real-world problems.
